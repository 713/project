Misc. notes
-----------
A good [very short description of Scrum](http://www.scottporad.com/2013/03/19/poor-mans-agile-scrum-in-5-simple-steps/), a project management method.  
We don't have to follow it closely.  
The __"Daily Standup"__ (step #4 in the previous link) might be a good suggestion:
+ "What did you do yesterday?"
+ "What will you do today?"
+ "Any obstacles that is hindering you from doing what you are going to do today?"

Any other suggestions/comments/concerns?  
Feel free to play around with Git and GitHub. I'll try my best to answer any Git questions if you have any.
