-- DESCRIPTION kr 2.0 --
kr version 2 rapidly computes a distance matrix based on shortest unique 
substring using a new algorithmic approach described in [1]. 
The program uses a recently developed alignment-free estimator of the rate 
of substitution, Kr [2]. 
In contrast to the implementation kr version 1 [2], where a suffix tree 
was constructed and traversed for each pair of sequences from the data set, 
kr version 2 is implemented by building a single suffix tree for all sequences 
from the data set, which is then traversed only once. 
This significantly reduces the runtime (for the speed comparison of kr 2 and 
kr 1 refer to [1]), while memory usage stays linear in the size of the data set.

-- RUNNING kr 2.0 --
Please, refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Using 32-bit version ("kr"):
Usage: kr [options] <FILES(s)>
   or: kr [options] -j <FILE(s)>
   or: kr [options] -d <DIRECTORY>

Using 64-bit version ("kr64"):
Usage: kr64 [options] <FILES(s)>
   or: kr64 [options] -j <FILE(s)>
   or: kr64 [options] -d <DIRECTORY>

Options (same for both versions):
   [-j <FILE> read subject sequence(s) from FILE(s)
   [-d <DIRECTORY> read subject sequence(s) from file(s) located in DIRECTORY
   [-o <FILE> write output to FILE; default: FILE=stdout]
   [-n <FILE> write output to FILE in the input format of phylip/neighbor]
   [-t print run-time]
   [-D <NUM> maximum depth of suffix tree; default: 1000000]
   [-P <NUM> fraction of random shustrings excluded from analysis; 
             P e [0, 1]; default: 0.5
   [-E <NUM> relative divergence error; default: 0.001000]
   [-T <NUM> relative error of the average shustring length; default: 0.000010]
   [-M <NUM> threshold for small values of logarithm; default: 0.000000]
   [-g use global GC content (fast); default: use pairwise GC content (slower, accurate)]
   [-p print information about program]
   [-h print this help message]

Note, all sequences must be provided in fasta format.

-- EXAMPLE kr 2.0 --

Running the test data set (a data set consisting of 42 HIV-1 genomes; 
for the reference, please check Doc/krDoc.pdf). 

Example:
1) switch to "Kr_2.x.x/Src/Kr" directory
	
2) run "kr" on the data set of sequences located in a single file, "hiv42.fasta":
	./kr ../../Data/hiv42.fasta
