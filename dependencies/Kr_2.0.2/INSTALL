============================= kr 2.x.x INSTALLATION README =====================

1) Extracting the tarfile:

"tar -xvzf kr_2.x.x.tgz"

2) switch to Kr_2.x.x/Src/Kr:

"cd Kr_2.x.x/Src/Kr"

3)for mac users only:
	edit Makefile, so CFLAGS and CFLAGS64 are changed to this:

CFLAGS= -O3 -Wall -Wshadow -pedantic -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -std=c99 -DVER32 -DUNIX -I/opt/local/include/ -L/opt/local/lib

CFLAGS64= -O3 -Wall -Wshadow -pedantic -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -std=c99 -DUNIX -I/opt/local/include/ -L/opt/local/lib

4) running make:

"make"

This command builds necessary libraries and two executables: "kr" and "kr64".
The executable "kr" is a 32-bit program and the executable "kr64" is a 
64-bit program. In general, "kr64" is adopted for large-scale data sets 
(over 0.5 Gb), and "kr" from smaller data sets.

5) If you want to use "kr" or "kr64" from any directory without referring to
"Kr_2.x.x/Src/Kr" source directory, simply include the path to these 
executables in the list of directories of the enviroment variable PATH, e.g:

PATH=${PATH}:$(HOME)/some-path/Kr_2.x.x/Src/Kr

or, copy it to your bin directory.
