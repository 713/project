============================= alfy INSTALLATION README =====================

1) Extracting the tarfile:

"tar -xvzf alfy_xxx.tgz"

2) switch to Alfy_XXX:

cd Alfy_XXX

3) Generate program

make

This command builds the libraries and two executables: "alfy" and "alfy64".
"alfy" is a 32-bit program and "alfy64" is a 64-bit program. In general, 
"alfy64" is used for large-scale data sets containing more than 5 x 10^8 bp, 
and "alfy" from smaller data sets.

5) If you would like to use "alfy" or "alfy64" from any directory without referring to
"Alfy_XXX/alfy", simply include the path to these executables in you PATH variable, e.g:

PATH=${PATH}:$(HOME)/some-path/Alfy_XXX

or copy the executables to your bin directory.
